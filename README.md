# Mask-Detector
This project uses MobileNetV2 to train a model to detect faces and if the people are wearing masks or not by accessing your webcam. The trained model is stored on the local hardrive, this model will store the weights of the trained model and will be used by our mask_detection file for prediction. To use this project download the project and the zip files which contains the dataset upon which model is trained and face_detector files. Then execute the train.ipynb first and then the mask_detection.ipynb.<br>NOTE: Make sure to change the paths wherever necessary.
